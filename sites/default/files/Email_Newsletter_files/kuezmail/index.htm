/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

      Since starting as your KUEZ Coordinator in May 2009 we’ve kept very busy here at the UEZ office; and I’m proud of what we have achieved. This newsletter will be one way we will strive to keep you up to date on our accomplishments, available programs, and many new and exciting activities.<br>
      In the last months we’ve invested a lot of time letting people know about our UEZ, attracting more shoppers into Kearny, and energizing the Zone.&nbsp; Have you seen our billboards?&nbsp; What about our cable TV commercials? Last spring we launched our first-ever Internet ad campaign and expanded our newspaper advertising into new markets, co-oping ad buys with many of our member businesses. We’re once again hosting the Holiday Tree Lighting Festival, which has over the last few years emerged as one our most popular town-wide traditions. Over the last months we’ve also sponsored the annual Easter Egg Hunt, a Spring Mothers’ Day Sweepstakes, the Farmers Market <em>(which continues through October 28th</em>) and our newest marketing campaign, the Kearny UEZ Town-Wide Yard and Sidewalk Sale which takes place this weekend and will introduce our Zone to new shoppers.<br>
      Important KUEZ infrastructure projects also continue, such as the Kearny Avenue Streetscape, the Sellers Street Area Roadway Reconstruction and Drainage project, the Jacobus Avenue Reconstruction project, and the repaving of several important business arteries. <br>
      We are always looking to expand our membership so more Kearny businesses can take advantage of the benefits the KUEZ has to offer -- such as the 3 ½% sales tax, low-interest Micro Loan and Revolving Loan Programs, and the Tax Exempt Status that our members enjoy, to name a few.&nbsp; So we welcome your help in spreading the word about the Zone!<br>
      As always, we are very receptive to the business needs in the community and we’ll do whatever we can to help fulfill those needs. You can always reach me at 201-955-7400 (ext.8041) or <a href="mailto:jpeneda@kearnynj.org">jpeneda@kearnynj.org</a>. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</span></p>

        KUEZ businesses are encouraged to capitalize on what is expected to be an influx of shoppers to the town that day and sponsor special sales. <br>
      Here's how it works: Any resident in town can have a yard sale that day at their home; and KUEZ members are being contacted and asked to join in the sale. <br>
      </span>KUEZ members hosting sales, as well as residential participants, will be included in a special Yard and Sidewalk Sale Map that will be distributed throughout Town and available on line for visiting shoppers. This way, buyers know where to stop and shop!<br>
        The Yard and Sidewalk sale will be aggressively advertised not only here in town, but also to several neighboring communities. &quot;Many other towns and communities have had great success with promotions such as these,&quot; said Coordinator Peneda.  &quot;We're hoping for similar success here in Kearny.&quot;<br>
