/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

Tune in! - KUEZ TV Commercials a Rating Hit!</a></h1>
<p>
The Kearny Urban Enterprise Zone just wrapped up its second in a series of television commercials on the Comcast Cable system with a spot promoting the KUEZ-sponsored Farmers Market as well as the many outdoor eateries here in Town. </p><p>
The first KUEZ TV campaign ran for five weeks during last year&rsquo;s holiday season, encouraging viewers to &ldquo;Discover Kearny!&rdquo; and its diverse shops and businesses.  &ldquo;We wanted to remind people that they could find that unique gift in Kearny, without the hassle of mall or large department store shopping,&rdquo; said Coordinator Peneda.  The commercials featured several KUEZ businesses as they showcased some of their one-of-a-kind goods. </p><p>
Both TV campaigns were broadcast throughout the day on a variety of channels, such as: A &amp; E, ABC Family, Bravo, CNN, Discovery, E, ESPN, Food Network, FX, Fox News, Galavision, Hallmark, HGTV, History, Lifetime, Nickelodeon, Oxygen, Soap, TBS, TLC, TNT, TV Land, USA, VH1, WE, ESPN Deportes, CNN en Espanol and Fox Sports en Espanol.</p><p>
As a result, nearly 26,000 households were reached from towns including not only Kearny, but also East Newark, North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford, East Rutherford, Carlstadt and Wallington.  </p><p>
All together, both campaigns will feature a total of 3,829 TV commercials.</p><p>
&ldquo;We are quite pleased with the results of the Comcast commercials,&rdquo; said Peneda. &ldquo;Not only have we had many member businesses report that customers were talking about the campaign, but we also substantially expanded the potential customer base for our KUEZ members.&rdquo; </p><p>
For those that do not subscribe to the Comcast Cable System, the newest commercial can be viewed on the Kearny website:  www.kearnynj.org and click on the link.</p>

<h1><a name="6">
NEW FIRE TRUCK for KFD</a></h1><p>
Thanks in part to the UEZ, the people of Kearny will now benefit from two new fire trucks purchased for our Kearny Fire Department (KFD).</p><p>
The first, a new custom pumper fire engine, was delivered to the KFD in June of last year.   Of the total $419,318 cost of the vehicle, $210,000 was underwritten by the KUEZ; the town matched the difference.</p><p>
A second new 2009 custom pumper is on now schedule to be delivered to the fire department early next year.</p><p>
&ldquo;The co-purchase of these two vehicles for the Kearny Fire Department is an excellent example of a successful collaborative effort between the KUEZ and the town that mutually benefits both our residents and the Zone,&rdquo; said Mayor Alberto Santos.</p>
<h1><a name="7">New Retail Promotion Set for October 16 - 
KEARNY TOWN-WIDE YARD and SIDEWALK SALE</a></h1>
<p>
Kearny residents are busy cleaning out their closets, attics and garages and getting ready for the first annual &quot;Town Wide Yard and Sidewalk Sale&rdquo; on Saturday, October 16 from 9 to 4 p.m.  Rain date is Saturday, October 23. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping this event helps energize the town and brings new visitors and shoppers into the Zone,&ldquo; said UEZ department head John Peneda.  </p><p>
KUEZ businesses are encouraged to capitalize on what is expected to be an influx of shoppers to the town that day and sponsor special sales. </p><p>
Here&rsquo;s how it works: Any resident in town can have a yard sale that day at their home; and KUEZ members are being contacted and asked to join in the sale. </p><p>
KUEZ members hosting sales, as well as residential participants, will be included in a special Yard and Sidewalk Sale Map that will be distributed throughout Town and available on line for visiting shoppers. This way, buyers know where to stop and shop!</p><p>
The Yard and Sidewalk sale will be aggressively advertised not only here in town, but also to several neighboring communities. &ldquo;Many other towns and communities have had great success with promotions such as these,&rdquo; said Coordinator Peneda.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping for similar success here in Kearny.&rdquo;</p><p>
For more information call the KUEZ office.</p>

<a name="8">NEXT ISSUE OF &lsquo;KEARNY MAGAZINE&rsquo; On Newsstands Soon!</a></h1><p>
On the heels of being feted as a Silver Award Winner of the Service Industry Advertising Award, the latest edition of the Kearny Magazine will be published early this fall.  This marks the 6th issue of the award-winning publication, designed to help promote the KUEZ, as well as the Town, as a great place to live, shop and work.</p><p>
Feature stories in this issue of the glossy, four-color publication will include &ldquo;One-of-a-Kind Kearny&rdquo; focusing on the many unique products, foods and services from some our members such as the Irish Crystal Shop, Magee Dart and Game Shop and Piper&rsquo;s Cove, as well an interview with KUEZ coordinator John Peneda who will explain changes in State UEZ rules and its benefits to smaller businesses.  </p><p>
Over 25,000 copies of the magazine will be distributed to not only to local residents, but also to households throughout Hudson County, prospective KUEZ businesses, and local and state officials.  &ldquo;The Kearny Magazine has been invaluable in helping us keep Kearny and the KUEZ in the news as part of our ongoing effort to promote and grow our Zone,&rdquo; said Peneda.</p>
<h1><a name="9">TOWN CALENDAR</a></h1><p>
Be sure to get your 2011 Kearny Town Calendar, which is underwritten by the KUEZ.  Copies will be available in December in the KUEZ offices, as well as various public buildings throughout town.</p>
<h1><a name="10">JACOBUS AVENUE PROJECT NEARING COMPLETION</a></h1><p>
Once completed this fall, the Jacobus Avenue Reconstruction and Drainage Improvements Project will dramatically improve the infrastructure in South Kearny and directly benefit the many active member businesses in that area of the Zone. The $1.8 million project, funded by the UEZ, included much needed work to separate sewers, enact drainage improvements and extensive roadway reconstruction along Jacobus Avenue.</p>
<h1><a name="11">SELLERS STREET AREA ROADWAY </a></h1><p>
Reconstruction and Drainage Project Continues</p><p>
Work to help alleviate persistent flooding issues and a deteriorated road system in the Sellers Street area in South Kearny is continuing, thanks to funding by both the Kearny UEZ and US Federal ARRA funds secured by the Town of Kearny.  &ldquo;Our members in this commercial area of our Zone came to us with this issue,&rdquo; said Coordinator Peneda.  &ldquo;This work on the Sellers Street area represents our commitment to listening and responding to all our members as we work together to improve and expand our KUEZ.&rdquo;</p><p>
The Kearny UEZ committed $1,019,640 to fund Phase I of this project.  The town was able to secure funds for Phase I through the US Federal ARRA funds, which paid for a majority of this phase of the project. Phase I is now complete and the Kearny UEZ has requested $1,169,400 to fund Phase II of the project, which includes O&rsquo;Brien and McWhirter Roads.  The Town of Kearny will once again try to secure more ARRA funds for this project phase.  Phase III of this project will include Gross Avenue and Rizzolo Road.</p>


<h1><a name="12">Hudson TMA – A Resource for Kearny - 
HUDSON TMA MAKES COMMUTE EASIER</a></h1>
<p>An important factor in the survival and growth of Kearny’s businesses is efficient mass transportation. Businesses depend on this resource not only for their customers, but employees as well.  The local agency assisting businesses in this regard is the Hudson Transportation Management Association (TMA). As a division of the Hudson County Improvement Authority, the TMA works to improve the commute for all travelers within Hudson County.  
</p><p>The Hudson TMA provides a number of services to help employers with their transit needs, all free of charge. A strong supporter of shared commuting, the TMA assists in the formation of shuttles, vanpools, and carpools. They host free Transit Fairs at various companies providing all of the information required to make the employees' commute a better experience for everyone. At a Transit Fair, a small table is set up in the company lunch room, cafeteria, or lobby during employee’s lunch hour(s). Information available to employees at a fair include: transit schedules, maps, carpool and vanpool applications, traffic alert subscriptions, and information on many incentive programs such the Emergency Ride Home and Switch to Mass Transit.
</p><p>Employees who register with the TMA will also be able to access the State-wide Rideshare Database to seek carpool or vanpool participants who live near where they live and work near where they work.  Funded by the federal government, the Hudson TMA works to simplify and improve travel for the general public and make your employees commute more efficiently.
 </p><p>The employer benefits when its employees have an easier commute. To arrange to meet with a TMA representative to learn more about how they can help your business, call them directly at 201-792-2825 or email at <a href="mailto:info@hudsontma.org">info@hudsontma.org</a>.  </p>
